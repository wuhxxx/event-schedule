## Introduction

This is a single-page event schedule web application which allows users to register/login and add/delete/remove events on weekday. Developed with MERN stack.

This app is inspired by [schedule-template](https://github.com/CodyHouse/schedule-template) and [login-signup-modal](https://github.com/CodyHouse/login-signup-modal). They are both from [CodyHouse](https://codyhouse.co/). I love building nice looking and elegant apps, but I'm not a designer... Thank them for open sourcing these components.

Developed the server from scratch, and built the responsive client web page by refactoring and combining two components mentioned above. These two components are written with JQuery, so I had to understand their source code and rewrite them using React and Redux. I also added some feartures such as toast message, event modal edit mode and add-event button.
